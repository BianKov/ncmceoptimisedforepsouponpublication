## Reference
B. Kov√°cs and G. Palla, *Optimisation of the coalescent hyperbolic embedding of complex networks*, Scientific Reports, 2021

## Usage
### Input files
The only input file is a text file containing the edge list of the network to be embedded. 

### Output files
Node coordinates on the native disk representation of the hyperbolic plane, edge list with link weights reflecting the hyperbolic proximity of the connected nodes, layout of the embedded network on the native disk.
